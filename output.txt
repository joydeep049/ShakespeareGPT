Scene: A Hall in a Nobleman’s House

Enter LORDS and SOLDIERS, with trumpets sounding.

FIRST LORD:
The drums have ceased; the lion-hearted foe
Bides silent now, as tempests after wrath.
What say the scouts? Hath he retreated hence,
Or gathers he his strength upon the hill?

SECOND LORD:
Not gone, my lord, but shadow’d by the dusk,
He sits as thunder clouded in the night,
To break upon the morrow with his force.
The earth itself seems lean’d to hear his tread.

FIRST SOLDIER:
A curse upon his pride! The man would feast
Upon the blood of all that call him foe,
And yet would leave no morsel for his kin.

SECOND SOLDIER:
Aye, such a man as breeds no fellow here.
His tongue is sharp as lances, yet his deeds
Shall make the sharpest steel seem blunt and dull.

FIRST LORD:
Peace, peace! The warlike trumpet speaks again.
We must not idle words while swords await.
Let valour arm the heart, for this shall be
A night that bends the stars to mortals’ fates.
Come forth! To council, then, to arms anon.
The world shall bear the scars of what we do.

Exeunt all but ONE SOLDIER.

SOLDIER:
O cruel day! Where honour is but dust,
And men are torn like leaves upon the gale.
Would I could flee this strife and find some peace,
But peace itself is banish’d from the earth.

Exit.
